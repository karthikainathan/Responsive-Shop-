                    <p>Organic farming is the production of food
                     without the use of synthetic chemicals or 
                     genetically modified components. Organic 
                     foods are not necessarily completely chemical 
                     free, but the pesticide residues will be considerably 
                     lower than those found in produce manufactured with 
                     synthetic chemicals.</p>

                    <h1>Organic Vegetables</h1>
                    <p>Organic vegetables are those that 
                    have been grown without the use of any 
                    synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or herbicides. 
                    They are typically grown in soil that is free of 
                    artificial chemicals, and their growth is monitored 
                    to ensure that they do not receive any 
                    harmful chemicals.</p>
